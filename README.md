# JavaDiplomat_Project
In this repository, I wil be updating my Java Diplomat project.

The diplomat consists of 11 modules, every module I will upload the new changes made to it.
Up until now, the project implements some Design Patterns and an UML diagram. (Module 2).
From now on, I wil update this file with all the changes made to the project.

July 8th. I need to implement JDBC to work with Databases. Specifically with MariaDB, as it is the DB manager taught to us in the course.
Later I will try to implement the same methods to work on an Oracle Manager.
